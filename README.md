# Simulated-Annealing-Algorithm-with-Metropolis-Criteria
Developed a Python-based Simulated Annealing Algorithm with Metropolis Criterion to solve complex optimization problems, comparing the performance of different cooling schedules (constant and variable cooling factors) to evaluate their impact on solution accuracy and convergence speed.
